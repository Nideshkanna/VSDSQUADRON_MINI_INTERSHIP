### **VSD Squadron Mini Internship**

Welcome to the **VSDSquadron Mini Internship Repository**. This repository contains all the lab exercises, project files, and learning outcomes from the **VSD Squadron Mini** internship, focusing on RISC-V architecture and embedded systems.

The **VSD Squadron Mini** is a versatile platform that bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications. This program is designed to enhance skills in embedded systems development using RISC-V-based processors, with a special emphasis on the **VSDSquadron Mini Board**, powered by the **CH32V003F4U6 RISC-V** chip.

### **Instructor: Kunal Ghosh**

The internship is led by **Kunal Ghosh**, a well-known expert in the semiconductor industry and RISC-V technology. Kunal has been instrumental in simplifying RISC-V for beginners and experienced developers alike. His workshops provide hands-on experience with practical tools and resources, empowering participants to become proficient in the domain of hardware-software co-design.

### **Internship Overview**

The internship is focused on hands-on exercises, including:
- **Understanding RISC-V architecture**.
- **Writing and compiling simple C code**.
- **Generating and analyzing RISC-V assembly code**.
- **Exploring the intricacies of the VSDSquadron Mini board**.

This repository is divided into several tasks, each designed to guide through the different aspects of RISC-V and embedded system development.

### **Project Structure**

- **task1/**: This folder contains the first lab exercise which involves writing and compiling a simple C program using the GCC compiler, followed by the same program being compiled using a RISC-V toolchain. It includes:
  - Step-by-step documentation for setting up the development environment.
  - C code, assembly outputs, and detailed snapshots of the compilation process.

### **Key Features of the VSDSquadron Mini Board**

- **Core Processor**: CH32V003F4U6 32-bit RISC-V core.
- **Memory**: 16KB Flash, 2KB SRAM.
- **GPIO**: 15 I/O ports with support for external interrupts.
- **Communication Interfaces**: USART, I2C, SPI.
- **Programming**: Onboard RISC-V programmer/debugger for seamless code deployment.

For more details about the boardâ€™s features, check the full documentation in the respective task folders.
